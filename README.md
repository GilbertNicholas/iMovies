# iMovies
Hi!, this is iMovies app. An app that made with The Movie DB as source code that provides list of movies based on genre. Check below for more information! 

## Description
iMovies is an app that made with UIKit Framework and VIPER architeture as its Architecture Pattern. 
<br>iMovies using dependency to The Movie DB (TMDB) API request for the data inside. I'm using Alamofire installed with cocoapods to managing the API request.
<br><br>
This app can do some interesting features, such as:
- Show Movie Genre List
- Show Endless Movie List by Genre
- Show Movie Detail 
- Show Endless User Review
- Show Youtube Trailer for Movie!

## Developer Guide
iBank is developed using Xcode 14.1 and Swift 5 programming languange <br>
iBank also developed with iOS Deployment Target iOS 16.1.<br>
I used some pods in the project, so make sure you install cocoa pods by using command: 
<br> pod install
<br><br>p.s: there are credentials (a.k.a APIKey, BaseURL) I've put in the plist file for safety reasons, but for testing purpose, I still include the Info.plist in the git so that testers can test my app quickly. :D
